1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jellyfin-user-manager.git
   cd jellyfin-user-manager
   ```

2. Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file if needed to adjust ports, environment variables, or volume mounts.

3. Start the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Access the application at `http://localhost:5000`

### Building from Source

If you prefer to build and run the application directly:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jellyfin-user-manager.git
   cd jellyfin-user-manager
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your PostgreSQL database and update the connection string in your environment variables.

4. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string | (required) |
| `NODE_ENV` | Environment mode | `production` |
| `PORT` | Port for the server | `5000` |
| `TZ` | Timezone | `UTC` |
| `PUID` | User ID (Docker only) | `1000` |
| `PGID` | Group ID (Docker only) | `1000` |

## Docker Configuration

### User / Group Identifiers

When using Docker, you can specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID` to match the ownership of your mounted volumes:

```yaml
environment:
  - PUID=1000
  - PGID=1000
```

This ensures that permissions issues are avoided when accessing mounted volumes.

### Volumes

- `/app/config`: Application configuration files
- `/app/data`: Application data storage

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jellyfin-user-manager.git

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start a PostgreSQL database (can use Docker):
   ```bash
   docker run -d \
     --name jellyfin-manager-db \
     -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
     -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
     -e POSTGRES_DB=jellyfin-manager \
     -p 5432:5432 \
     postgres:15-alpine
   ```

4. Set environment variables in `.env` file:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/jellyfin-manager
   ```

5. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
